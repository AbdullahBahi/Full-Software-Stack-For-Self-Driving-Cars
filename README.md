# Full-Software-Stack-For-Self-Driving-Cars
This repo contains all my work on [Coursera's Self-Driving Cars Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars), **the details of each project is found along with project files in the README files of each project.**  
  
## Specialization Overview
This Specialization gives a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry. I interacted with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle (AV)â€•all through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA.  
Throughout all courses, there was interviews with industry experts who work at companies like Oxbotica and Zoox as they share insights about autonomous technology and how that is powering job growth within the field.  
I learned from a highly realistic driving environment that features 3D pedestrian modelling and environmental conditions. When I completed this Specialization successfully, I was able to build my own self-driving software stack.
